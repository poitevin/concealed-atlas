# Concealed Atlas of Our Approaching Demise

**An interactive digital poem encoded in a 2.2-million-mile aviation itinerary.**

This browser-based artwork is composed entirely from IATA airport codes. Each three-letter code contributes letters to the final poemâ€”its title, epigraph, and entire body of text. The poemâ€™s structure thus encodes a planetary circuit through 312 distinct airports.

The poem doubles as a carbon ledger: at an estimated 160 million kilograms of COâ‚‚ equivalents, each line reveals the environmental cost of its own emergence.
