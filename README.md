## Concept

**_Concealed Atlas of Our Approaching Demise_** is a digital poem composed entirely from IATA airport codes‚Äîeach line generated by concatenating three-letter codes to form poetic phrases. Together, they construct a **2.2 million‚Äìmile global flight itinerary**, encoding not only linguistic meaning but also **carbon emissions**, **distance traveled**, and the **infrastructural systems** of modern aviation.

This work makes visible the inextricable links between global mobility and ecological collapse. Visitors toggle between three views:
- **Poetic Line** ‚Äî the surface language of the work
- **Airport Code Sequence** ‚Äî the constraint-based generator
- **Environmental Metadata** ‚Äî distance and CO‚ÇÇ output for each poetic unit

The poem cannot exist without producing the very crisis it describes.

## Artist Statement

Pedro Poitevin is a bilingual poet and mathematician whose work explores the intersections of constraint, language, and formal systems. Author of six books of poetry, including _Nowhere at Home_ (Penteract Press, 2023), his practice bridges traditional forms and avant-garde experimentation.

This piece continues a lineage of **Oulipian poetics**, **systems art**, and **eco-conceptualism**, inviting viewers to reflect on complicity, embodiment, and the poetics of global catastrophe.
